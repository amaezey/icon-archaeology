Since Amigas allow icons of any size, most ofthem were larger than the Windows 32x32 standard size, meaning Ihad to scale them down and redraw bits.  The original set hadover 100 icons, some just didn't look very good scaled down.- 1998-11-12: v1.1  Added: Gazelle petroglyph, Thai Buddha, stone Bast statue,         Thoth, Naxian sphinx, llama doll, Aztec serpent and         pyramid, Roman arch, Mars face, Tudor knight, and         scroll.---------------WHATS INCLUDED?---------------  Icons are grouped as follows:  ¥ Continent(s)/Planet    - Icon    ¥ Region/Period      - IconICONS: (77)  ¥ Africa    - Ghana Mask    - Maasai shield    - Saharan gazelle petroglyph stone    ¥ Egyptian      - Ankh      - Goddess Bast statues (3: gold & stone full and gold close-up)      - Queen Nefertiti Bust      - Obelisk      - Pharaoh Tutankhamun gold mask      - Pyramids (plain and worn)      - Scarab beetle amulet (3 different patterns and shades)      - Shawabti      - Sphinx      - Thoth baboon statue  ¥ Americas    ¥ Mesoamerica      - Olmec basalt head      - Terracotta mask (Teotihuacán)      ¥ Aztec        - Pyramid        - Serpent pectoral (half)      ¥ Mayan        - Chacmool (sacrifical altar)        - Crystal skull    ¥ North America      - Arrow point    ¥ South America      - Nazca hummingbird pot      ¥ Inca        - Animal pot        - Llama doll        - Tumi knife  ¥ Asia    - Angkor Thom statue head    - Tibetan Prayer Wheel    - Small Thai Buddha    ¥ China      - Ban liang coin    ¥ India      - Buddha statue (emaciated)      - Ganesha statue      - Jamadhar (thrusting knife)      - Nandi statue (Shiva's Bull)    ¥ Japan      - Clay Rat (decorated and plain)      - Daibutsu (Great Buddha of Kamakura)      - Kabuto (Samarai helmet)      - Stone Lantern      - Torii gate    ¥ Near East      - Assyrian Shedu guard      - Cuneiform tablet      - Golden Calf (Canaanite)      - Sumerian helmet      - Ziggurat  ¥ Europe    - Mother Goddess figurine    ¥ Medieval      - Byzantine Cross      - Crusader shield and helmet      - Knight helmet      - Tudor knight & shield    ¥ Northern      - Sutton Hoo helmet (Anglo-Saxon)      - Trilith      ¥ Celtic        - Cross pendant        - Horse ornament from a yoke      ¥ Norse        - Dragon ornament from ship vane        - Man's head pendant        - Helmet        - Shield    ¥ Greek      - Corinthian capital      - Helmet (Spartan)      - Shield (Spartan)      - Sphynx (Naxian)      - Temple    ¥ Roman      - Arch (ruined aquaduct)      - Comet coin ("Deified Julius")      - Helmet      - Shield  ¥ Mars    - Face  ¥ Oceania    - Moai (Easter Island head)    - Tiki  ¥ Extras    - Moiety dagger from Riven(TM)    - Pyramid folder    - Scroll-----------------LEGAL MUMBO-JUMBO-----------------These icons are copyrighted freeware for any non-comercial useor distribution.
