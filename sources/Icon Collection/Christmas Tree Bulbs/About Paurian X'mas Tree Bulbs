The fresh smell of pine filled the house. I remember turning off all of the lights so that only the tree was lit. Time would pass by so quickly just staring at the ornaments as they reflected the glow of the lights on the tree.I appreciate the time my wife has given me to create these Icons. They were origonally started before Mac OS 8.5 with just a few bulbs. With the introduction of thousands of colours available for icons with that OS release, I went back to revisit some of the old designs and built from scratch a few more which allowed me to use more realism and more imagination.Legality - Terms of use:The file used to extract this text and all associated files, in binhex (.hqx) or stuffit (.sit) format herein is named "this package".
