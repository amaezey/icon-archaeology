And I wanted something that looked good in OS X (think big), used transparency, and was colorful. These icons might not look as good under OS 9, since the gradient from the transparency to color is so quick in 32x32, the effect is less noticeable.<br>					<br>					Well, I hope you like it.<br>					<br>					Talos</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>				</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>				</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>Legality:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>					Peel Off is copyright &copy;2001 The Iconfactory.

In Mac OS 9 (and earlier), when you press Command-I, you get a Get Info window for each item you have selected in the Finder. With Mac OS X, there is no Get Info.<br>					<br>									Get Info has been replaced with an &quot;Inspector&quot;. The inspector is shown or hidden when you press Command-I. It also behaves differently; every time you select something in the Finder, the inspector shows additional information about the item. The good news is that even though the Inspector works differently, it still allows you to change icons for most desktop items.<br>					<br>									Here is a step-by-step guide for setting a folder icon:<br>									1) Select a file or folder that has the icon you want to use.<br>									2) Press Command-I to bring up the Inspector panel.<br>									3) Click on the icon once. You should see a gray border around the icon (see figure.)<br>									4) Press Command-C to copy the icon. Do NOT close the inspector panel.<br>									5) Select the file or folder that you want to customize. Press Command-V to paste the icon.<br>									That's it!<br>					<br>				</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>Changing the Hard Drive</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>									You may notice that the copy and paste operation mentioned above won't work<br>									on the main hard drive. When you click on the icon, there is no gray border.<br>									To change the hard drive, you need to have full administration access. You<br>									should logout (using the Application menu) and login again using &quot;root&quot; with<br>									your normal password. Once you've changed your icon, you should logout and<br>									return to your normal user login. Thanks go out to David Williams and Derek Closson<br>									for pointing out this trick.<br>					<br>				</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="red"><b>NOTE: </b>The preceding technique could be used in the Public Beta.This may not work under OS X 10.0. Setting custom icons for hard drives and network folders in OS X 10.0 does not initially appear to be possible as of this writing (3/25/01). This may change in future releases or if someone finds a clever way around this. </font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>					<br>					<br>				</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>Important Notes About Copying &amp; Pasting 8.5+ Icons</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>									In Mac OS 8.5 and above, there are two types of custom icons you can use: old-style with only 256 colors and the new style with 32-bit icons. The Finder only copies and pastes the new style. This is a more efficient use of disk space.<br>					<br>									However, if you paste the Mac OS 8.5 icon on removable media, such as a floppy or Zip disk, the icon won't show up when you move to an older version of the OS. You'll also have problems on a network server and an older client Mac.<br>					<br>									By default, the Iconfactory's IconDropper 3.2 utility pastes both kinds of icons so they will show up on any version of the OS that supports custom icons. To learn more about IconDropper 3.2, please visit the Iconfactory at &lt;http://www.iconfactory.com&gt; Thanks!<br>					<br>				</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>How To make Use of Icons:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>									The most common use of custom icons is as a replacement for the standard file and folder icons that are built into your Mac's operating system. Many people find that it is much easier to find a file that you are looking for by spotting a cool, colorful icon rather than by its name. Icons can be cut and pasted onto almost any item on the Macintosh. For the most part however, they are just a whole lot of fun. As for how to apply them, here is the most straight forward way:<br>					<br>									1. On your desktop, select the icon you would like to use<br>									2. Select &quot;Get Info&quot; (command-I) from the File Menu for that icon<br>									3. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window<br>									4. Choose &quot;Copy&quot; (command-C) from the Edit menu<br>									5. Close the window<br>									6. Select the file/folder you want to apply that icon to<br>									7. Select &quot;Get Info&quot; (File menu) for that icon<br>									8. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window<br>									9. Select &quot;Paste&quot; (command-V) from the Edit Menu.<br>									(this method won't work on the trash can)<br>									10. You're done!<br>					<br>				</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>Contact The Author:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>Talos Tsui -<a href="mailto:talos@iconfactory.com">talos@iconfactory.com</a><br>					<br>									The Iconfactory - <a href="mailto:webmaster@iconfactory.com">webmaster@iconfactory.com</a><br>					<br>				</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>More Stuff for your Mac:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>									As a showcase for all of our pixel-pushing icon work, we've created a place called The Iconfactory.
