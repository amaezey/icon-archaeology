December 1998A Balanced BreakfastIcon CollectionIntroduction:Mmm.. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.This set is the first PixelPress icon set that is MacOS 8.5 ready. They will work just as well under operating systems previous to 8.5, but not earlier than 7.0. If you do not have MacOS 8.5 there will be fewer colours, and no levels of transparency to the icons.You may notice a wide range of styles in some of these icons. In particular, the maple ayrup, and the kettle icons. I've found my work looks a lot more photographic when I actually have the object I'm iconizing infront of me. Hopefully, my style will become consistant as I make more of them.I would like to thank Hideki Itoh of Hide's Icon Showcase (http://www.vcnet.com/hide/download/icons.html) for his guidance in the making of these icons, and teaching me more than a few lessons.Legality:The enclosed icons are ©1998 PixelPress.
