Some of us are happy with our old       Colour Classics or Performas, some are enthusiastically unpacking their       brand new iBooks, iMacs or G4s and others are rebuilding their old computers       - into aquariums. <br>      <br>      MacQuarium lets you experiment with the idea of installing fish into your       Mac without actually having to go through with the project. Or, as the case       may be, in celebration of your MacTank. It lets you paste both fish and       the latest hardware on your desktop. It carries vintage models and the newest       machines. Both Discus and Guppy. Hopefully MacQuarium makes you feel a little       dreamy.<br>      <br>      At any rate, you will not have to install OSX to view this fishy set of       icons. <br>      <br>      Kate<br>      <br>      </font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>Thanks       &amp; Acknowledgements:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>      Thanks Colin Wirth at <a href="http://come.to/macquarium">MacQuarium</a>       for planting the idea for this set in my mind, for letting me expand on       the theme and for sharing </font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva">these       icons with the world. <br>      <br>      Thanks to Craig Hockenberry for IconDropper, without which my extensive       collection of icons would be a maze!</font></p>    <p><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva">Thank you Sofia for your       friendship, for all those late night calls, SMSs from France and friendly,       delicious dinners at your kitchen table.

The       Finder only copies and pastes the new style. This is a more efficient use       of disk space.<br>      <br>      However, if you paste the Mac OS 8.5 icon on removable media, such as a       floppy or Zip disk, the icon won't show up when you move to an older version       of the OS. You'll also have problems on a network server and an older client       Mac.<br>      <br>      By default, the Iconfactory's IconDropper 3.2 utility pastes both kinds       of icons so they will show up on any version of the OS that supports custom       icons. To learn more about IconDropper 3.2, please visit the Iconfactory       at &lt;<a href="http://www.iconfactory.com">http://www.iconfactory.com</a>&gt;       Thanks!<br>      <br>      </font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>How       To make Use of Icons:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>      The most common use of custom icons is as a replacement for the standard       file and folder icons that are built into your Mac's operating system. Many       people find that it is much easier to find a file that you are looking for       by spotting a cool, colorful icon rather than by its name. Icons can be       cut and pasted onto almost any item on the Macintosh. For the most part       however, they are just a whole lot of fun. As for how to apply them, here       is the most straight forward way:<br>      <br>      1. On your desktop, select the icon you would like to use<br>      2. Select &quot;Get Info&quot; (command-I) from the File Menu for that icon<br>      3. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window<br>      4. Choose &quot;Copy&quot; (command-C) from the Edit menu<br>      5. Close the window<br>      6. Select the file/folder you want to apply that icon to<br>      7. Select &quot;Get Info&quot; (File menu) for that icon<br>      8. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window<br>      9. Select &quot;Paste&quot; (command-V) from the Edit Menu.<br>      (this method won't work on the trash can)<br>      10. You're done!<br>      <br>      </font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>Contact       The Artist:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>      Kate England- <a href="mailto:dave@iconfactory.com"> kate@iconfactory.com</a><br>      <br>      The Iconfactory - <a href="mailto:webmaster@iconfactory.com">webmaster@iconfactory.com</a><br>      <br>      </font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>More       Stuff for your Mac:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>      As a showcase for all of our pixel-pushing icon work, we've created a place       called The Iconfactory.
