Each is drawn completely by hand in Adobe           Photoshop, with gratuitous use of the paintbrush and line tools, and           the 'gaussian blur' and 'add noise' filters for leaf and stone effects.</font>         <p>         <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> I am           very proud of all I've learned making these icons, and have discovered           a skill in illustration that I didn't know I had.</font>         <p>         <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> And while           speaking of 'firsts', this is the first year I've entered the Iconfactory's           'Pixelpalooza' contest. I've always shyed from the yearly contest because           I didn't feel that my silly, fragile ego could handle losing to all           the great artists who enter and win every year, and so I avoided the           whole thing.</font>         <p>         <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> But perhaps           the subject matter of this set has had some effect on my moral, because           for the first time I'm not afraid of losing, I'm just happy to be entering           and sharing a set that I loved making.<br>          <br>          </font>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="121" valign="top" height="163">       <div align="center"><b><span class="boldbody"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#990000">About         Feng Shui</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000099"><br>        <br>        </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><img src="Images/icon-kakejiku.jpg"></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000099">         </font></span></b></div>    </td>    <td valign="top" width="12" height="163"></td>    <td width="312" valign="top" height="163">       <p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> There are         many definitions of what the art of Feng Shui is all about, but it can         probably be agreed that it is the art of bringing good energy into living         spaces and the lives of those people who visit those spaces. Through arrangement         of structures, furniture and decoration good energy is encouraged and         bad energy is deflected.</font>       <p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> While a         room doesn't have to be themed with Asian objects or design in order to         adhere to Feng Shui principles that is the commonly imagined style of         a place with good Feng Shui.</font>       <p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> I really         know very little about Feng Shui.</font> <br>        <br>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="121" valign="top" height="985">       <div align="center"><b><span class="boldbody"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#990000">Icon         Detail </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>        <br>        </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000099"><img src="Images/icon-kirinoren2.jpg"></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">         </font></span></b></div>    </td>    <td valign="top" width="12" height="985"></td>    <td width="312" valign="top" height="985"><font size="-1"> </font>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">If you like         to read 'ReadMe's, then you're in for a special treat!

They won't be repeated in the set!)</i></font>      <p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> <b><i>Tsukubai</i></b>         - This is a water basin found in traditional gardens, and fed by a spring.         This was origianlly just the basin, but I added the ladel and bamboo rod         afterwards because it lacked the grace of the other icons in the set,         and because the general oval form of the basin was boring.</font>       <p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> <i><b>Ishidourou</b></i>         - This lantern was compiled from 3 traditional designs so it's pretty         original. I know that Dave Brasgalla (of the Iconfactory) has already         done an icon depicting a snow lantern, but I really wanted to include         one in this set so I made my own.</font>       <p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> <i><b>Gunsen</b></i>         - A fan, kind of a military design.</font>       <p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> <i><b>Chouchin         Shinku</b></i> - This lantern was inspired by the huge lanterns that hang         at each gate of Asakusa Temple in Japan. '<i>Shinku</i>' is a Japanese         word for crimson.</font>       <p>       <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Katana         & Sheath</font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">         - Pretty self explanitory, I textured the sheath with an oak grain to         try and make the weapon seem less offensive and a little more rustic.         The artwork I created for this icon is huge, over 1000 pixels wide. Originally         I illustrated some wrapping on the sheath, but it got lost when I shrunk         the illustration down.</font>       <p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> <b>Koi</b>         - Those wonderful, huge goldfish are a favourite fish of mine. If you         place this icon on a coloured background you can see the reflection of         water over the icon quite clearly. This icon was harder to make than it         looks.</font>       <p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> <i><b>Kouka</b></i>         - The iChing is a method of fortune telling and divination that involves         tossing coins. These are traditional designs of the head and tails.</font>       <p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> <b>Kimono</b>         - I designed the patterns myself too. Sometimes garments are hung on the         wall as decoration.</font>       <p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> <i><b>Kakejiku</b></i>         - This hanging scroll is on the same level of perspective as the default         MacOS X hard drive icons. The original lettering isn't nearly as elegant         as it looks on this icon - my calligraphy is horrible, especially with         a mouse. It's like trying to draw with a brick. I don't know what the         calligraphy says.</font>       <p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> <i><b>Shodou</b></i>         - This calligraphy set was lots of fun to make since it's got so many         components. The character on the scroll is Chinese (I think) - 'ambition'.         The brush was fun and I drew it much larger than it's pictured here, in         case I need to use it for something else.</font>       <p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> <i><b>Geta</b></i>         - My wife owns a pair of these little sandals, named for the sound they         make when walked in. I tried to keep the perspective the same as that         used on the hanging scroll.</font>       <p>       <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Ba Gua</font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">         - I don't know the whole story behind these mirrors, but Feng Shui practitioners         use them, and I think they're used to ward off bad spirits too. Ba Gua         is also a martial arts form based on walking in circles.</font>       <p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> <i><b>Chouchin         Kuroshiro</b></i> - '<i>Kuroshiro</i>' means 'black and white' in Japanese.         The sakura leaf design is an original design I used on one of my album         covers.</font>       <p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> <i><b>Chouchin         Reinensai</b></i> - '<i>Reinensai</i>' means 'festival' in Japanese. The         tailed circles are a take-off on a traditional design. I did this third         lantern because a friend of mine suggested that I do several different         lanterns after the first one, the '<i>Chouchin Shinku</i>'.</font>       <p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> <b>Bonsai</b>         - I used lots of the 'add noise' filter on this icon to create the texture         of gravel and leaves. The edge where the leaves meet the void of the desktop         was probably the hardest part to get right. Out of all the icons I think         this one could use a little more work.</font>       <p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> <i><b>Torii</b></i>         - A temple gate, I designed it out of a combination of classic styles.</font>         <br>        <br>        <br>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i><b>Shamisen</b></i>         - This is a 3 stringed instrument that is strummed with a large plectrum         much like a guitar or lute.<br>        <br>        <br>        <i><b>Fuurin</b></i> - '<i>Fuurin</i>' is Japanese for 'wind chime'. traditionally         the bell is made from wrought iron but now-a-days they're common in blown         glass as well. The bell depicted here is glass, chosen to show off a well-ultilized         glass effect.</font>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>        <br>        </font>     </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="121" valign="top" height="197">       <div align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b><span class="boldbody"><font color="#990000">Legality</font><font color="#000099"><br>        <br>        <img src="Images/icon-katana.jpg"></font></span></b></font></div>    </td>    <td valign="top" width="12" height="197"></td>    <td width="312" valign="top" height="197">       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The icons         and images represented by these icons are original artwork Copyright &copy;2002         Gary W.
