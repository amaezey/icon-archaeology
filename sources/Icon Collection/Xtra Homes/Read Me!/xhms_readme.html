Apple's little house icon is nice, but just a tad               ethnocentric - so I started this series of slightly more varied               housing types.

In Mac OS 9 (and earlier), when you press           Command-I, you get a Get Info window for each item you have selected           in the Finder. With Mac OS X, there is no Get Info.<br>          <br>          Get Info has been replaced with &quot;Show Info&quot;. The Show Info           inspector is shown or hidden when you press Command-I. It also behaves           differently; every time you select something in the Finder, the inspector           shows additional information about the item. The good news is that even           though the inspector works differently, it still allows you to change           icons for most desktop items.<br>          <br>          Here is a step-by-step guide for setting a folder icon:<br>          1) Select a file or folder that has the icon you want to use.<br>          2) Press Command-I to bring up the inspector panel.<br>          3) Click on the icon once. You should see a gray border around the icon           (see figure.)<br>          4) Press Command-C to copy the icon. Do NOT close the inspector panel.<br>          5) Select the file or folder that you want to customize. Press Command-V           to paste the icon.<br>          <br>          Depending on the icon being replaced, you may need to restart the computer           to view the new icon.<br>          <br>          That's it!<br>          <br>        </td>      </tr>      <tr>         <td width="130" valign="top">           <div align="right"> <b><span class="boldbody">iControl</span></b><br>          </div>        </td>        <td valign="top"></td>        <td width="450" valign="top">What is iControl?<br>          <br>          iControl is quite simply the easiest, quickest, and most friendly way           to change every icon in your Mac's System Folder... plus the Trash Can!           Want to change the way the default folder looks when you create a new           one on the desktop? iControl makes customizing this very easy.

The Finder only copies and pastes the new           style. This is a more efficient use of disk space.<br>          <br>          However, if you paste the Mac OS 8.5 icon on removable media, such as           a floppy or Zip disk, the icon won't show up when you move to an older           version of the OS. You'll also have problems on a network server and           an older client Mac.<br>          <br>          By default, the Iconfactory's IconDropper utility pastes both kinds           of icons so they will show up on any version of the OS that supports           custom icons.

Many people find that it is much easier           to find a file that you are looking for by spotting a cool, colorful           icon rather than by its name. Icons can be cut and pasted onto almost           any item on the Macintosh. For the most part however, they are just           a whole lot of fun. As for how to apply them, here is the most straight           forward way:<br>          <br>          1. On your desktop, select the icon you would like to use<br>          2. Select &quot;Get Info&quot; (command-I) from the File Menu for that           icon<br>          3. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window<br>          4. Choose &quot;Copy&quot; (command-C) from the Edit menu<br>          5. Close the window<br>          6. Select the file/folder you want to apply that icon to<br>          7. Select &quot;Get Info&quot; (File menu) for that icon<br>          8. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window<br>          9. Select &quot;Paste&quot; (command-V) from the Edit Menu.<br>          (this method won't work on the trash can)<br>          10.
