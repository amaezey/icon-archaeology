... some inquisitive aliens will take you up to their space ship, and drill holes in your private parts.Alien Icon Set  (26th February, 2000)The icons in this set are optimised for Mac OS 8.5 and above.  They look ok under previous system versions, and as Windows icons, just not as cool as they could be (Windows needs an 8 bit mask, damn it!).The usual spiel:  don't go pretending this set is your own creation; don't go making money from it by using it in an application (freeware applications are ok, if you contact me first); you may pass the set around, just make sure you keep the read me with it (and let me know if it's to go on a CD), and you can put it up on a web page if you contact me for my approval first.Important note:  Despite how it looks, my Roswellian aliens were not copied off some of Layne Karkruff's DCs - there are only so many ways to go about drawing Roswellian aliens.  I suspect I've used the same 3D filter that he's used in the past, hence the strong similarities.  Sorry about that, Layne.Tracy Ann ConnollySaffron Graphicssaffron@raingod.comhttp://www.raingod.com/saffron
