Just wanted         to say thanks for downloading the Winter Games icon set. It is my hope         that these icons wouldn't just be another set to put on your computer         somewhere, but that it would go beyond the images on your screen and maybe         into your heart a little.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ten years ago, I made         the most important discovery of my life, and if you have a moment, I'd         like to share it with you. Nothing in this life is going to last forever.         Your computer will become obsolete in a few years, er, months. These icons         are just barely OS X savvy! Your car is eventually going to break down.         The flowers in your yard won't last, and as much as I hate to say it,         neither will you. However, there is one thing that will last. Or should         I say one person who will last: Jesus Christ.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I know, I know...         you’re thinking, "Hang on, I just wanted the icons!" But please, keep         reading. The icons are free, you can take 2 minutes to read this... :         )</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Back in the very first         garden, Eden, everything was perfect—Until the first man Adam, disobeyed         his Creator, God. And because of his disobedience, Adam was sentenced         to die—not a physical death—but a spiritual one. And everyone who came         after Adam has found his or herself in this same place. God's Word, the         Bible says in Romans 3:23, <i>"All have sinned and come short of the glory         of God."</i> And because of that sin, when our time is out here on earth,         we are sentenced to die in the same way Adam did. Not just physically,         but spiritually—sentenced to spend eternity apart from God in hell.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But it does not have         to end that way. 2000 years ago, God sent His Son, Jesus Christ to earth         to take our sins upon Himself. He was killed—Crucified on a Roman cross,         to save this world from an eternity seperated from God. He was buried,         but three days later He rose again to conquer death, and to give us eternal         life! All we need do is believe. Romans 6:23 says, <i>"For the wages of         sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus         our Lord."</i></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Riches won't get you         into heaven. Owning a PowerBook G4 or New iMac, as cool as they are won’t         get you there. Being a "good" person won't get you there either. Only         Jesus Christ will get you there. <i>"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ         and you will be saved."</i> Acts 16:31 God has forgiven you. He has pardoned         your sin. Now you have the choice to make. It's that simple. Do you believe?</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you have never         asked God to forgive your sin before, you can do it now. Pray this simple         prayer if you like:</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCCC">"Father         in Heaven, I know I have disobeyed your commands. I know I am a sinner,         and I know there is nothing I can do to get myself into heaven. I confess         that to you now, and I ask for your forgiveness. Thank you for sending         your Son, Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sin. Thank you for forgiving         me. Amen."</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you did just pray         this for the first time, I am so happy for you. And I pray that someday         we can meet in person, whether here, or in heaven someday. If you don't         have one, get yourself a Bible and start reading it. The book of John         is a good place to start learning more about God and His love. Thanks         for taking the time to read this. I hope you realiza how much this means         to me. Maybe it has even changed your life. If it has, I'd love to know.         <a href="mailto:joshwa@yellowlane.com">Drop me a line</a> some time. And         I hope you enjoy the icons.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sincerely y</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ours,<br>        Josh         Williams</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      </td>    <td>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
