I do hope you enjoy them.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These icons are inspired         by a couple of my favorite things to do when I'm not sitting behind my         Mac &#151; Skiing and Snowboarding. I've attempted to create a bit of         community with these icons, including some colorful characters to brighten         up your desktop.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before I go too far         though... Icons in Mac OS X rock! I've tried to create some of the icons         where they can be layered, as you will see below. The possibilities are         endless. Have fun stacking these up on your desktop!<br>        </font><img src="Images/wgscreenshot.jpg" width="400" height="300"><br>        <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some         of the icons are definitely taken from specific memories of mine during         time I've spent in the Southern Rockies (Yes, the broken wrist really         happened). Others are purely fictional, and figments of my imagination         (or perhaps representations of who I'd be if I could be a ski bum!) Unfortunately,         as time is always a constraint, I have not been able to put into icon         form all the ideas I have had. So perhaps there will be a Winter Games         2 coming soon. We shall see!</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#CCCCCC">Without         Further Ado:</font><font color="#333366"> </font></b>Many thanks go to         Joel, Rich, Mark, Chris, Wesso, and Keith for making the annual Red River         trips with me.
