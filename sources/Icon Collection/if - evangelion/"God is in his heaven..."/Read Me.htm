I was a big anime fan, but I wasn't sure I wanted to get into a new series from scratch and get familiar with a new bunch of characters, back story and complex plotlines. I can say now that watching this series was one of the most enjoyable anime viewing experiences I ever had. Why?<br>				<br>				If you already know and love Eva, then you know why. If you're not familiar with the series, but are curious then you owe it to yourself to either rent them or purchase them and check it out. Evangelion is a masterful tapestry of story, characters, epic themes, kick-ass action, beautiful painted backdrops and deep introspection. If I went into too much detail, I would ruin the story and the intent behind the series and that is something I won't do. Suffice to say that if you stick with the series, you most likely won't be disappointed. A word of warning however... the ending is nothing that you expect.<br>				<br>				The <b>if : evangelion</b> collection contains over 30 hand-drawn freeware icons for the Macintosh. I created the set because 1) I love Evangelion and 2) almost all the other Eva icons out there don't do the characters justice. I decided to create the de-facto collection of Eva icons based on as many unique poses and approaches to the characters as I could find. Some of the icons turned out outstanding, some simply good. My favorites in this collection are Kaoru, Asuka and SASCHIEL. In addition, I've created a series of original folder icons based on the colors and general feel of the Evangelions themselves. I hope these give the set a unique &quot;Iconfactory&quot; flavor that you won't find in any other Eva set.<br>				<br>				Lastly, if some of the character names are not spelled how you think they should be, suck it up and re-name them on your desktop how you think they should be spelled. I've encountered so many different spellings of the English character names, I could not be 100% sure of any of them. I'm sorry, but that's the breaks. Don't loose sleep over them, just ENJOY! :-D<br>				<br>				<br>				</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>More about Evangelion:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>				<br>				Official GAINAX Website - <a href="http://www.gainax.co.jp/" target="_blank">http://www.gainax.co.jp/</a><br>				<br>				Evangelion on DVD in the USA - <a href="http://www.advfilms.com/main.html" target="_blank">ADV Films</a><br>				<br>				Guide to Neon Genesis Evangelion - <a href="http://www.lwhy.clara.net/nge/" target="_blank">http://www.lwhy.clara.net/nge/</a><br>				<br>				Guide to Evangelion Angels - <a href="http://www.cybercombatclub.com/anime_mangas_divx_nohentai_repertoire/fr_mangas_anime_video_divx_neon_genesis_evangelion_repertoire/evangelion_ange_angel.htm" target="_blank">cybercombatclub.com</a><br>				<br>				More Eva icons for the Mac - <a href="http://www.cc.rim.or.jp/~kahoo/icon.html" target="_blank">http://www.cc.rim.or.jp/~kahoo/icon.html</a><br>				<br>				<br>				</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>Thanks &amp; Acknowledgements:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>				All the thanks for this set really go to GAINAX and all of the talented people behind Evangelion.

The Finder only copies and pastes the new style. This is a more efficient use of disk space.<br>				<br>				However, if you paste the Mac OS 8.5 icon on removable media, such as a floppy or Zip disk, the icon won't show up when you move to an older version of the OS. You'll also have problems on a network server and an older client Mac.<br>				<br>				By default, the Iconfactory's IconDropper 3.2 utility pastes both kinds of icons so they will show up on any version of the OS that supports custom icons. To learn more about IconDropper 3.2, please visit the Iconfactory at &lt;<a href="http://www.iconfactory.com">http://www.iconfactory.com</a>&gt; Thanks!<br>				<br>				<br>				</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>How To make Use of Icons:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>				The most common use of custom icons is as a replacement for the standard file and folder icons that are built into your Mac's operating system. Many people find that it is much easier to find a file that you are looking for by spotting a cool, colorful icon rather than by its name. Icons can be cut and pasted onto almost any item on the Macintosh. For the most part however, they are just a whole lot of fun. As for how to apply them, here is the most straight forward way:<br>				<br>				1. On your desktop, select the icon you would like to use<br>				2. Select &quot;Get Info&quot; (command-I) from the File Menu for that icon<br>				3. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window<br>				4. Choose &quot;Copy&quot; (command-C) from the Edit menu<br>				5. Close the window<br>				6. Select the file/folder you want to apply that icon to<br>				7. Select &quot;Get Info&quot; (File menu) for that icon<br>				8. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window<br>				9. Select &quot;Paste&quot; (command-V) from the Edit Menu.<br>				(this method won't work on the trash can)<br>				10. You're done!<br>				<br>				<br>				</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>Contact The Artist:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>				<br>				Gedeon Maheux- <a href="mailto:gedeon@iconfactory.com">gedeon@iconfactory.com</a><br>				The Iconfactory - <a href="mailto:webmaster@iconfactory.com">webmaster@iconfactory.com</a><br>				<br>				<br>				</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>More Stuff for your Mac:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>				As a showcase for all of our pixel-pushing icon work, we've created a place called The Iconfactory.
