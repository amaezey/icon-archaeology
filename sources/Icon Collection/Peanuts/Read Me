Ê                                               "You're an Icon, Charlie Brown"                                                                  The Peanuts Icon CollectionBy Edward MundyOctober 4, 1997Celebrating the 47th birthday of everyone's favorite Beagle, this is the world's largest icon collection based Charles Schulz's classic comic strip, "Peanuts." It contains 40 icons based on the characters from the strip, including many never before iconized characters like Snoopy's entire family, major and minor supporting characters, and classic personas from years past. Each icon is hand-crafted by yours truly and the collection is entirely free. The icons are optimized to appear in both 16 and 256 colors. I recommend using WinZip to unzip them as it will preserve the Windows95 long filenames. Enjoy decorating your desktop with your favorite blockheads, beagles, and world-famous alter egos.Thanks to all the folks on alt.comics.peanuts who have given me feedback, to those other artists who have inspired me by turning iconing into an art form, especially Jeanette Foshee, Shelby Miller, and Gedeon Maheux, and very special thanks to Charles Schulz for his constant devotion to the comic strip that has changed the industry and continues to entertain us fifty years later.Peanuts is copyright ©1997 United Features Syndicate, Inc. These icons are fan art and are not intended as copyright infringement. You may freely distribute this collection as long as this readme file is included and no money is charged for them.Please tell me what you think of these. As they are my first icon release in a couple years, I am eager to hear what you net-denizens think of them. Send comments, questions, criticisms, etc. to me at the address below. Also, let me know which icons you like (if any), which you don't, what I could do to improve them, and what you would like to see in future volumes. I look forward to hearing from you!To find this collection and all future updates, as well as other cool icon sets available nowhere else, visit Ed's House of Icons at: 																				http://members.aol.com/Rerun1138																																											-Ed Mundy (Rerun1138@aol.com)þþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþPS.
