Adam wrote to simply ask if we were ever going to make any more iPacks available for our system icon replacement utility, iControl. And if we were, was there any possibility of making a holiday themed one?<br>									<br>									I at first dismissed the idea simply because I knew how much work was involved with making an all-new iPack system replacement set. An artist needs to create over 80 icons if you want to really cover every major icon contained in the system folder. However, the more I thought about it, the more I thought it could be a great set. I tried a couple of test icons in the Kidcon style, and then I was hooked. I didn't want to make the set overtly based around candy canes, santa or other traditional holiday garb, so I decided to go with a more subtle, winter theme of snow covered mountains, holiday colors and snowflakes.<br>									<br>									The majority of these 87 icons were made in a single afternoon of frantic pixel-pushing listening to Christmas music. All the major iControl system icons are covered, plus an additional 13 custom folder icons for things like music, games and popular Mac applications like LimeWire. All this, plus some cozy Alpine desktop pictures that should help you complete your Macintosh make-over.<br>									<br>									I sincerely hope you enjoy this new, fun icon collection. It was a blast to make and really brought me back to the enjoyable time I had making the original Kidcon collections. If you liked this set, <a href="mailto:gedeon@iconfactory.com">please write me and let me know</a>. I hardly hear from anyone anymore if they like my sets. So if you like it, be sure to write! Its all I ask for.

In Mac OS 9 (and earlier), when you press Command-I, you get a Get Info window for each item you have selected in the Finder. With Mac OS X, there is no Get Info.<br>								<br>																	Get Info has been replaced with an &quot;Inspector&quot;. The inspector is shown or hidden when you press Command-I. It also behaves differently; every time you select something in the Finder, the inspector shows additional information about the item. The good news is that even though the Inspector works differently, it still allows you to change icons for most desktop items.<br>								<br>																	Here is a step-by-step guide for setting a folder icon:<br>																	1) Select a file or folder that has the icon you want to use.<br>																	2) Press Command-I to bring up the Inspector panel.<br>																	3) Click on the icon once. You should see a gray border around the icon (see figure.)<br>																	4) Press Command-C to copy the icon. Do NOT close the inspector panel.<br>																	5) Select the file or folder that you want to customize. Press Command-V to paste the icon.<br>																	That's it!<br>								<br>							</td>						</tr>						<tr>							<td width="130" valign="top">								<div align="right">									<b><span class="boldbody">iControl</span></b><br>								</div>							</td>							<td valign="top"></td>							<td width="450" valign="top">What is iControl?<br>								<br>								iControl is quite simply the easiest, quickest, and most friendly way to change every icon in your Mac's System Folder... plus the Trash Can!

The Finder only copies and pastes the new style. This is a more efficient use of disk space.<br>								<br>																	However, if you paste the Mac OS 8.5 icon on removable media, such as a floppy or Zip disk, the icon won't show up when you move to an older version of the OS. You'll also have problems on a network server and an older client Mac.<br>								<br>								By default, the Iconfactory's IconDropper utility pastes both kinds of icons so they will show up on any version of the OS that supports custom icons.

Many people find that it is much easier to find a file that you are looking for by spotting a cool, colorful icon rather than by its name. Icons can be cut and pasted onto almost any item on the Macintosh. For the most part however, they are just a whole lot of fun. As for how to apply them, here is the most straight forward way:<br>								<br>																	1. On your desktop, select the icon you would like to use<br>																	2. Select &quot;Get Info&quot; (command-I) from the File Menu for that icon<br>																	3. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window<br>																	4. Choose &quot;Copy&quot; (command-C) from the Edit menu<br>																	5. Close the window<br>																	6.
