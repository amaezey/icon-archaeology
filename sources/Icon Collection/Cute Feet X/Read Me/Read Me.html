These icons have now been updated from their previous state to work fully with Mac OS X and Windows XP.</p>      <p>Like some of our other older icon sets, Cute Feet was never intended to be seen any larger than 32 x 32 pixels. Creating 128x128 and 48x48 pixel versions has been a wonderful treat, creating very much of a rough drawn look to these icons.</p>      <p><b><font color="#990000">Most 		Special-est Thanks:</font><font color="#333366"> </font></b>To Rach &#151; Who has the cutest feet and coolest shoes.</p>      <p>And as always, thanks 		to all for your interest and support!
