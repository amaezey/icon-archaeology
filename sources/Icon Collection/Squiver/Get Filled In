Squiver iconsby David CatmullWhat's in the name?Well it has these sliver-looking outlines, filled with scribbles... I don't know where the q came from. I guess it just sounded better than "Scriver." One of those things where it started as a working title and I never came up with anything better.How did this happen?When everyone was still getting used to the idea of Apple's new photoreal 128x128 icons, there was some discussion about the merits of the photorealistic vs illustrative styles. This of course made me wonder, what if Apple had done the new icons as illustrations?The making of...I started with the Finder icon, which is the only one that I did freehand; the rest were all done by tracing over the original icons. I'm thinking of also doing a set of hardware icons (iBook, iMac, etc.) in the same style.These icons were made entirely using Adobe Photoshop and the to-be-released Icon Machine III. Photoshop 6's new vector graphics features came in very handy (wish they had that when I was making Sprightly), although it would have been even better to have live stroking of the paths as well as live filling. Ironically, the black outlines are filled and the color fills are stroked.Ulterior motiveThis set was created for the Iconfactory's Pixelpalooza 2001 contest.
