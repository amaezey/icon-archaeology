Quicksilver G4 icon á by David Catmull á uncommon@uncommonplace.comAnother MacWorld, another new Mac. And while it didn't have the dramatic new look that everyone was hoping for, the similar enclosure made it a lot easier for me to make this icon. So I just thought I'd do my part to help tide everyone over until Apple's Next Big Thing actually happens. Enjoy.© 2001 David Catmull.
