Squiver Hardware á by David Catmull á uncommon@uncommonplace.comWhen I made the original Squiver set, I considered doing this second set... and what finally motivated me to do it was the introduction of the new iMacs. Or, more specifically, the discontinuation of the Sage and Ruby colors. Sage was my favorite iMac color. So in memory of all the lost iMac colors, I made this set which features them all, from Bondi to Snow... plus a few other things.I'm not going to attempt Flower Power and Blue Dalmatian (yes, that is how you spell it), because I'm not that fond of them, and besides they just don't fit the Squiver style.Thanks go to Apple for making their computers so Squiverable, and to MacDesktops.com for having so many pictures to draw from.© 2001 David Catmull.
