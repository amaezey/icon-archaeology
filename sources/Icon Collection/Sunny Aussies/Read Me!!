SUNNY AUSSIES ICONSETHello!Thanks for downloading this sunny lil bunch of warm aussie locals. I love the australian fauna and created them to play a part in a much larger continent by continent set, but found myself preferring to keep them seperate, in the end dropping the others to focus solely on them.These exotic and beautiful creatures {many exclusively australian} are compelling, often overlooked and thats a shame..they're too cute! I hope I've done them justice.Please enjoy these lil' guys, designed to give you warm and sunny thoughts of a far off country full of sunshine and light.Legally Basics..They are free for personal use only.
