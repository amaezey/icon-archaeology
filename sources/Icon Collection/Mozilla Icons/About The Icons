Mozilla IconsThese are some Mozilla Icons that I made. With any luck the Mozilla will soon become everyone's browser of choice, but there haven't been any cool Mozilla icons for Mac OS X until now!The art for the icons comes from the Browser itself and the Mozilla project.  All artwork contained within these icons remains the copyright of The Mozilla Organization.If you like them, let me know.  You may feel free to contact me at tomhackett@mac.comHave fun, -Tom Hackett
