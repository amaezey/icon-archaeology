This time around I've tried to add a definate creep factor that I hope has made it through to you, the end user.<br>							<br>							Each icon has a mini ghost story to tell, but I think I'm most proud of the Zuni Fetish icon. This one is based directly from a movie from the 70's called Trilogy of Terror. Its about this nasty little tribal doll that comes to life and hunts and stalks Karen Black around her apartment. I saw it when I was at an impressionable age and I think I'll just say that it scared the crap out of me. I was definately shooting for spooky on this one and I think it works well.<br>							<br>							At the very least, I shot for subject matter that was slightly off-beat this year and I hope you enjoy the results.</font><br>						<br>						<br>					</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b><font color="#33FF00">Legality:</font></b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>      <font color="#999999">The enclosed icons are &copy;2002 The Iconfactory.

In Mac OS 9 (and earlier), when you press Command-I, you get a Get Info window for each item you have selected in the Finder. With Mac OS X, there is no Get Info.<br>						<br>						Get Info has been replaced with &quot;Show Info&quot;. The Show Info inspector is shown or hidden when you press Command-I. It also behaves differently; every time you select something in the Finder, the inspector shows additional information about the item. The good news is that even though the inspector works differently, it still allows you to change icons for most desktop items.<br>						<br>						Here is a step-by-step guide for setting a folder icon:<br>						1) Select a file or folder that has the icon you want to use.<br>						2) Press Command-I to bring up the inspector panel.<br>						3) Click on the icon once. You should see a gray border around the icon (see figure.)<br>						4) Press Command-C to copy the icon. Do NOT close the inspector panel.<br>						5) Select the file or folder that you want to customize. Press Command-V to paste the icon.<br>						<br>						Depending on the icon being replaced, you may need to restart the computer to view the new icon.<br>						<br>						That's it!<br>						<br>						<br>					</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b><font color="#33FF00">Setting Classic Mac Icons:</font></b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>					</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#999999">The most common use of custom icons is as a replacement for the standard file and folder icons that are built into your Mac's operating system. Many people find that it is much easier to find a file that you are looking for by spotting a cool, colorful icon rather than by its name. Icons can be cut and pasted onto almost any item on the Macintosh. For the most part however, they are just a whole lot of fun. As for how to apply them, here is the most straight forward way:<br>						<br>						1. On your desktop, select the icon you would like to use<br>						2. Select &quot;Get Info&quot; (command-I) from the File Menu for that icon<br>						3. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window<br>						4. Choose &quot;Copy&quot; (command-C) from the Edit menu<br>						5. Close the window<br>						6. Select the file/folder you want to apply that icon to<br>						7. Select &quot;Get Info&quot; (File menu) for that icon<br>						8. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window<br>						9. Select &quot;Paste&quot; (command-V) from the Edit Menu.<br>						(this method won't work on the trash can)<br>						10. You're done!</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>						<br>					</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#999999"><br>					</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b><font color="#33FF00">Contact The Author:</font></b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>      <font color="#999999">Gedeon Maheux - </font><a href="mailto:gedeon@iconfactory.com"><font color="#33FF00">gedeon@iconfactory.com</font></a><br>      <br>      <font color="#999999">The Iconfactory - </font><a href="mailto:webmaster@iconfactory.com"><font color="#33FF00">webmaster@iconfactory.com</font></a><br>						<br>						<font color="#33FF00"><br>      </font></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#33FF00"><b>More       Stuff for your Mac:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>      <font color="#999999">As a showcase for all of our pixel-pushing icon work,       we've created a place called The Iconfactory.
