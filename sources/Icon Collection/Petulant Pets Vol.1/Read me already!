Petulant Pets all           began with the pink elephant. He was my first attempt at an icon designed           for the new 128x128 thumbnail standard in OS X. I finished the graphic           and was quite pleased with it, until I tried to squeeze it into the           smaller resources (the 32x32 and 16x16 sizes that OS X still uses in           Finder windows). I put that pachyderm through a variety of crops and           contortions (you begin to see why he's so cranky) but I just couldn't           make it sharp enough. It was too detailed for the smaller sizes. So,           the Pink One found himself relegated to the icon dustbin and a downward           spiral of grouchiness.</i></p>        <p> <i>Then I got my hands on the public beta and began to discover that,           in the new order of things, 32x32 icons had been demoted. They appeared           about as frequently and in about the same role as their 16x16 cousins.           The new thumbnail icons were given top billing, appearing in the dock,           on the desktop, and in the preview pane of the Finder's column view.           I realized that the focus in Mac icons had shifted. Now, instead of           designing for the 32x32 size and sparing some attention for the 16x16           size, iconists would design for 128x128 and spare some attention for           the 32x32 and 16x16 sizes.</i></p>        <p> <i>To make a long story short, the elephant was saved and was joined           by a few of his friends. After establishing a "petulant style," I thought           it would be amusing to extend it to some system elements. Hence the           folders, trash cans and Mac hardware.</i></p>        <p> <i>If you don't see your favorite beast or box here, hang on tight.           This is just volume 1. I hope to address the question of irritable iMacs           and iBooks, cranky Cubes, and a host of agitated animals, in future           volumes.</i></p>        <p><i> <i>This is my first set designed from the ground up with OS X (and           Aqua) in mind. The icons are meant to be seen in that environment, and           won't look nearly so nice in OS 9 and earlier (the folders and hardware           do fare better in 9 than the others).</i></i></p>       <p><strong>|</strong><b>Usage</b><strong>|</strong><cite>|</cite><em>What           to do with 'em</em><cite>|</cite><br>          <i>Icons and graphics &copy; 2000 John Marstall.
