Squiver Hardware 2 á by David Catmull á uncommon@uncommonplace.com

I've been wanting to release a second set for a while. Originally it was going to be the first hardware set with additional icons. But I figure there are enough new things to merit a separate set, especially since Apple is going in a different direction with their hardware designs.

I've noticed that I've strayed a bit from the look of the original Squiver set, mostly in that the scribbles aren't as loose as they were. I've tried to steer the new icons back in that direction, but I kind of like it this way. These things evolve over time, and it's often for a good reason.
