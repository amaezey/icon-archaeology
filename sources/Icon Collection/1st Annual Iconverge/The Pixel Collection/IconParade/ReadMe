This year, the artist's task is to create icon interpretations of 3 words.The words are determined by their answers to the following questions:1. What word do you love?2. What word do you hate?3. What word do you fear?OK, here we go:1. I love summer - really hot and sunny summer, with 25¡C in the evening after the sun sets etc.The first thing that came to my mind when I should illustrate summer was milk. I've always been a milk drinker, but the best milk of all is the milk that has been touched by sun. I call it "sun kissed".  Hey, I'm not talking about sun-warm milk, or something else equally yiacky. I mean milk that has just been standing in the sun for a couple of seconds, a minute something (I've never scientifically tested it!), just enough for some chemical process to start. The milk gets a sweeter taste, but not like you've poured sugar in it, just a wee bit sweeter, and slightly almond tasting. THAT's summer to me... =o)2.This was easy! I hate what humans do to animals for their own pleasure, and the worse crime of all must be fashion fur industry! If you've even seen a mink farm or fox farm you know what I mean. How can anyone wear a coat made of fur when they know what the poor animals have suffered to get there, and how many it took?? That's beyond me. Don't get me started... I'm one of those who wants to spray paint fur coats when I see one (I've never done it though)... =o)3.Hard one... I fear a lot of things, but most of them were hard to turn into icons. My biggest fear is to die alone without a family. That didn't make such a good icon... So I did a trivial one, that probably 4 others have done too. I fear heights. Not panically, but much enough. It's not "oh, it's so high, I'll get killed if I fall", it's more of the "what if I suddenly get a flip and just jump?" sort of fear... oh, well...Sarawww.iconparade.comsara@iconparade.com
