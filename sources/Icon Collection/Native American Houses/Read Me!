Calle's Custom IconsI like to personalize everything about my work, and I work a lot in front of my computer. So I started to collect icons, made by others. But often I didn't find the perfect icon for a particular use. Working as an illustrator artist, I just can’t settle with the boring original file icons, and using only icons made by others also becomes a drag after a while.  So I started making my own icons instead, and soon I discovered how fun that was. Then I continued making them. And my collection grew, and grew, and grew...My icons are made in a combination of Photoshop and ResEdit. Then I get the best of both of these programs.  ____________________________________________________________________• The Native American Houses Icons Making a set of house icons (The Village) for IconTown, rendered me a lot of appreciation, and also inspiration from other icon artists.This set of icons is inspired by, and dedicated to Sonny Del Castillo, who makes wonderful icons with Native American motifs. Since Sonny is a Caddo and Osage indian, I promised to make him an icon with a Caddo house. This grew a little (as it often does), and here are now a little set of houses from different corners of North America.____________________________________________________________________These Iconsare Freeware – you may use them freely for personal purposes. But if you want to use my designs elsewhere, like for a commercial purpose, you have to contact me to settle all the legal and financial stuff.If you like them and use them, please tell me! You can either mail me at cjr@telia.com, or call, fax, or send me a letter or a postcard. Maybe You have made some good-looking icons for my collection?Have Fun!Best wishes fromCarl Johan RehbinderRehbinder MultiArt ProductionsVoxnegränd 7S-128 43  BAGARMOSSENSWEDENTel/fax: +46-8-649 41 49E-mail: cjr@telia.comHomepage:http://www.multiart.nu/cciAnd:Sonny Del CastilloE-mail: poison64@aol.comHomepage: http://members.aol.com/poison64/private/index.html____________________________________________________________________
