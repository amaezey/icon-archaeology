Greetings!Hey, thanks for downloading my icons!  I'm sure my warehouse inhabitants won't match up to some of the other wonderful pixel pushing talent out there, but hey, it's all in good fun!  If you happen to find these useful, neat looking, or absolutely repulsive, feel free to drop me a line at mikeapolis@mac.com.  Also try dropping by my totally hip web site, Texture Paradise (http://textures.digithought.net/).Thanks again!  oh and uh, beware the creature in the crate, he gets really nasty when he doesn't get his morning coffee.by Mike Apolismikeapolis@mac.comhttp://textures.digithought.net/
