This icons were made from original PowerBook G4 images found at apple's website (www.apple.com). These icons are 100% freeware and you can use them for your personal use only. You can distribute this icons only in their original .sit.hqx form and the file must include this readme.Some of these icons are not hi-quality (ex. G4 chip) because they were made from poor quality jpgs. Anyway some tricks in photoshop made them look at lest fine.For comments, suggestions or other info contact me at pafmax@clix.ptEnjoy!Pedro Fern‡ndez
