The Finder only copies and pastes the new style. This is a       more efficient use of disk space.<br>      <br>      However, if you paste the Mac OS 8.5 icon on removable media, such as a       floppy or Zip disk, the icon won't show up when you move to an older version       of the OS. You'll also have problems on a network server and an older client       Mac.<br>      <br>      By default, the Iconfactory's IconDropper 3.2 utility pastes both kinds       of icons so they will show up on any version of the OS that supports custom       icons. To learn more about IconDropper 3.2, please visit the Iconfactory       at &lt;http://www.iconfactory.com&gt; Thanks!<br>      </font><br>      </font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b><font color="#33FF00">How       To make Use of Icons:</font></b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>      <font color="#999999">The most common use of custom icons is as a replacement       for the standard file and folder icons that are built into your Mac's operating       system. Many people find that it is much easier to find a file that you       are looking for by spotting a cool, colorful icon rather than by its name.       Icons can be cut and pasted onto almost any item on the Macintosh. For the       most part however, they are just a whole lot of fun. As for how to apply       them, here is the most straight forward way:<br>      <br>      1. On your desktop, select the icon you would like to use<br>      2. Select &quot;Get Info&quot; (command-I) from the File Menu for that icon<br>      3. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window<br>      4. Choose &quot;Copy&quot; (command-C) from the Edit menu<br>      5. Close the window<br>      6. Select the file/folder you want to apply that icon to<br>      7. Select &quot;Get Info&quot; (File menu) for that icon<br>      8. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window<br>      9. Select &quot;Paste&quot; (command-V) from the Edit Menu.<br>      (this method won't work on the trash can)<br>      10. You're done!</font><br>      <br>      </font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b><font color="#33FF00">Contact       The Author:</font></b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>      <font color="#999999">Dave Brasgalla - </font><a href="mailto:dave@iconfactory.com"><font color="#33FF00">dave@iconfactory.com</font></a><br>      <br>      <font color="#999999">The Iconfactory - </font><a href="mailto:webmaster@iconfactory.com"><font color="#33FF00">webmaster@iconfactory.com</font></a><br>      <font color="#33FF00"><br>      </font></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#33FF00"><b>More       Stuff for your Mac:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>      <font color="#999999">As a showcase for all of our pixel-pushing icon work,       we've created a place called The Iconfactory.
