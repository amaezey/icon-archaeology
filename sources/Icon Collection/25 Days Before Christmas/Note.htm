For each day, you have a little present (a chocolate, a small toy, or a picture).<br>			It's this idea I've followed for this icons set: an icon per day till Christmas.<br>			<br>			So we'll prepare everything for being ready on Xmas day! =c)<br>			<br>			<b>1:</b> Ok, it's a bit early for that, but be sure to have your Xmas sock ready!<br>			<b>2:</b> Now, let's buy the presents for the whole family. Here's a nice one for Mum: her favorite perfume.<br>			<b>3:</b> This book will please to Dad.<br>			<b>4:</b> And this toy is for Baby.<br>			<b>5</b>: Now, we have to pack the presents... Here's the one for Mum<br>			<b>6</b>: Let's have a break: it's Santa Claus' day!<br>			<b>7</b>: We go on our packaging with the present for Dad.<br>			<b>8</b>: And last, the present for Baby.<br>			<b>9</b>: Haven't we any Xmas cards to write today?

First... candies! =c)<br>			<b>16</b>: Oranges are very popular fruits for Xmas. A long time ago, when it was harder to find some in winter, they were a precious Xmas present for children.<br>			<b>17</b>: The drink, now... Champagne.<br>			<b>18</b>: The chocolate box, to offer to our guests.<br>			<b>19</b>: But we have to taste the chocolates first... just in case... =c)<br>			<b>20</b>: The Xmas cake is in the fridge... creamy and nauseous! =cD<br>			<b>21</b>: For our traditionnal Xmas meal, we need chestnuts...<br>			<b>22</b>: And a big and fresh turkey.<br>			<b>23</b>: Put the turkey in oven...<br>			<b>24</b>: Now we have our turkey with chestnuts, ready to be eaten tonight, for the Xmas eve.<br>			</font><font face="Geneva" size="2" color="#a86500"><b>25</b></font><font face="Geneva" size="2">: Merry Christmas to all of you! =c)<br>			<b>26</b>: no comments...<br>			<br>			<i>And please, excuse the stereotypes... Offering a perfume to Mum and a book to Dad doesn't mean than Mum doesn't know reading =c)...
