 The Under The Sea CollectionJanuary 11, 2001Introduction:I’ve been fascinated by the ocean since I was a kid. Now that the macintosh may display more than 256 colours in icons (since Mac OS 8.5), some ideas have been toying in my head. This is the first icon set done in more than 256 colours, and offered some challeneges that pixel by pixel icon creation didn’t.As you can see, the icon set contains various deeper sea creatures that aren’t as commonly seen. I’ve liked tubeworms since I was in grade school, so I had to do one. The crab I am particularly fond of because my brother and I would torture them at the beach by laying them on their backs to see them work their way back to their feet. Good memories. Hope you enjoy using them as much as I’ve enjoyed making them.Legality - Terms of use:The file used to extract this text and all associated files, in binhex (.hqx) or stuffit (.sit) format herein is named "this package".
