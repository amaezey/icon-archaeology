Hey, where are the icons?These icons are designed specifically as 128x128 pixel thumbnail icons for Mac OS X.  Users running system software prior to Mac OS X might not see the Gigantic icons.  However you may still be able to view 32x32 pixel and 16x16 pixel renditions of the icons if your monitor is set to 32-bit color.   Additionally, Large (48x48 pixel) icons are included for use with Mac OS X Server.Life is Good -  Version 1.0 by Charles Chéné - December 7, 2000 Optimised for Apple's MAC OS XCC & CompanyThanks for viewing/downloading these icons...hope you all enjoy them.Created with the following stuff:1.
