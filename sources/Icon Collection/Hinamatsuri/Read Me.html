It took me months to build up the energy for this icon set; it required a lot of research and quite a bit of work. I'm very proud of the result and have much to tell you about the subject matter!

<i><font color="#FFFFFF">What is Hinamatsuri?</font></i>
<p>
Hinamatsuri is the Japanese Doll Festival, celebrated on March 3rd. On this day prayers are given for young women's growth, happiness, and quick marriage. The festival is also known as Momo no sikku, or the Peach Festival, as this is the season for peach blossoms. This isn't an official holiday, but it is a tradition that is very dear to the hearts of the Japanese.
<p>What really characterizes Hinamatsuri are the Hinaningyô, the Hina dolls that begin to be displayed around Mid-February. They must be removed very quickly after the day of the festival though, or the young women in question will have difficulty getting married. Originally the dolls were made of paper: they were kept for a year then floated down a river to take away with them the owners' sins and bad luck.<p>
Just like the santons in a Nativity scene, the Hina dolls are a set series of characters. They are dressed in the ancient court costumes of the Heian period (794-1185) and reconstruct the Japanese court of the time. A complete set has at least 15 of them. With this icon set, consider yourself the lucky owner of a full set plus the full 7-tiered display!<p>
<i><font color="#FFFFFF">What does each doll-icon stand for?</font></i>
<p>For the icons I have used the dolls' Japanese names. Here is their translation and additional notes for each.<p><i>Dairibina (Imperial pair):</i><br><b>Obina</b> (or Dairi): the Emperor. He wears an ikausokutai, an ancient nobleman's dress, and the kanburi hat with a crest on top of it. In his right hand he holds the shaku sceptre, symbolizing his rank. There is a sword on his left side.<br><b>Mebina</b>: the Empress. Her costume is the jûni-hitoe, a twelve-layered ceremonial robe with which the hair is gathered at th enape of the neck and hangs down the back. She wears a jûnihitoe, an elaborate crown, and holds a fan.<p><b>Bonbori</b>: Lantern.
<br><b>Momo no hana</b>: Peach blossoms, traditionally placed between the imperial couple.<p><i>Sannin kanjo (Ladies-in-waiting):</i><br><b>Kuwae-no-chôshi</b>: she is standing and holds a short-handled ladle to serve sake.<br><b>Sanpô</b>: the middle lady, seated and holding the pot of sake.<br><b>Nagoe no chôshi</b>: she stands and holds the long-handled ladle.<p><i>Gonin bayashi (Five Musicians):</i><br><b>Taiko</b>: the small drum, seated.<br><b>Ôkawa</b>: the large hand drum, standing with his drum over his shoulder.<br><b>Kotsazumi</b>: the hand drum, standing as well.<br><b>Fue</b>: the flute.<br><b>Utaikata</b>: the singer with a folding fan.<p><i>Zuishîn (The Ministers):</i><br><b>Udaijin</b>: Minister of the Right, a strong young man.<br><b>Sadaijin</b>: Minister of the Left. He is older and wiser than the first and has a long white beard. Both of them carry a bow and arrows.<p><b>Hishimochi</b>: diamond-shaped rice cakes made of three layers. The top layer is pink like peach blossoms that chase evil spirits away. The middle layer is white, for snow and purity. The bottom layer is green for health. The diamond-shaped stands carrying them are called hishidai.<p><b>Eji</b>: Household servants. The one on the left carries the Emperor's hat wrapped; the one on the right carries his wrapped parasol.<b>Shicho</b>: the attendant, carrying the Emperor's shoes.<p>
<i>The Trees at the gate:</i><br><b>Ukon no sakura</b>: the mandarin tree.<br><b>Sakon no tachibana</b>: the cherry tree. These two trees represent those planted on both sides of the gate to the old Japanese court in Kyoto.<i>The imperial furniture:</i><br><b>Tansu</b>: a chest of drawers.<br><b>Nagamochi</b>: a small chest.<br><b>Kyôdai</b>: a dresser.<br><b>Hibachi</b>: a brazier.<br><b>Ochadôgu</b>: a tea ceremony set.<br><b>Jûbako</b>: lacquered boxes used for food.<br><b>Haribako</b>: a sewing box.<br><b>Kago</b>: a palanquin.<br><b>Gissha</b>: an oxcart for nobles of the heian era.

<i><font color="#FFFFFF">How do we place the dolls on the display/desktop?</font></i><p>The desktop provided with the set is naturally meant to be not just a background, but also a display for the icons (for the lazy among you, simple Japanese patterns can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.cedarseed.com/icons.html">CedarSeed</a> to use with the icons). You are of course free to play with them as you wish, but traditionally the dolls are placed as follows:
<p>
<i>Ichidan (first or top tier):</i> 
<br>The Emperor on the right (that's your left; any reference to left or right is given from the Emperor's point of view), the Empress on the left. Between them, the peach blossoms, and on either side two lanterns.
<p>
<i>Nidan (second tier):</i><br>The three ladies in waiting with the short handle on the right, the sake holder in the center, and long handle on the left.
<p>
<i>Sandan (third tier):</i><br>The five musicians: small drum, drum over shoulder, hand drum, flute, singer.
<p>
<i>Yondan (fourth tier):</i><br>The Minister of the Right, then one rice cake, two dinner trays, another rice cake and the Minister of the Left.
<p>
<i>Godan (fifth tier):</i><br>The mandarin tree (always planted on the right), the servant bearing the hat, the attendant, the servant bearing the parasol and the cherry tree (always on the left).
<p>
<i>Rokudan (sixth tier):</i><br>A bunch of imperial furniture: chest of drawers, small chest, dresser, brazier, tea ceremony set.<p>
<i>Nanadan (seventh and final tier):</i><br>Lacquered boxes used for food, a sewing box, a palanquin and a noble's oxcart.<p>Some more terminology: The display itself is known as Hinadan, and the red carpet covering it is the Môsen. The gold folding screens on the top tier are Byôbu.
