Since I got tired of the ugly (imho) (mk)Linux on the PPC, I made up some nice icons (32-bit) for both mine and your desktops.Replacing Application/File IconsSince we all of love ResEdit, these icons are of course in the format of ResEdit files. To install you can use one of two different methods. The easiest method is to fire up shareware clip2icons 1.1.1, and paste them into the files you want. Another method (slightly harder, but free) is to use ResEdit to paste them into the file you want. Replacing LinuxPPC Kernel Folder IconIf you want to install the LinuxPPC Kernel Folder icon, you must first create an invisible folder icon, by pasting any icon on the LinuxPPC Kernel Folder. That should create a file called Icon inside of the Linux Kernel folder. Use Resedit to replace the contains of this file (yes to replace icons with the same names). Rebuild the Desktop. Your new icon should appear.Enjoy! Feel free to improve my icons, or to repackage them. If you want to give credit, that cool, if not that's okay. And yes they are under gpl license.
