Glassy Folders27th of January, 2000These icons are designed to be viewed on a monitor that can handle thousands or millions of colors.  These icons are not for commercial use - use them on your desktop, or on a non-profit web page, but don't go making money out of them, please.  Contact me if you have any queries regarding this.  If you want to pass them around to friends, please keep the readme doc with the icon set.The Silly Stuff folder contains icons for use with some desktop pics I've made (http://www.raingod.com/saffron/deskpics).[Support the Icon Factory: use Icon Builder.  I did.]Tracy Connollysaffron@raingod.comhttp://www.raingod.com/saffron
