But partly it's because the           Mac GUI is more highly refined than it once was. I have to &quot;polish&quot;           my icons so thoroughly because now I'm making them for a very polished           computing environment.</i> </p>        <p><i>It's the hardest thing to convey to someone who hasn't lived with           the platform, but there's a certain quality about the Mac that makes           it more than a computer. Perhaps it's "friendliness." Perhaps it's "attention           to detail." I can't articulate it, except to call it "Macintoshness."</i></p>        <p><i>There was a real concern among Mac users when OS X first started           materializing as a real system that this quality of "Macintoshness"           had been sacrificed in favor of stability, interoperability, modernization,           etc. I think it really did make users think about switching to Windows.           As I sit here typing this within 10.1, however, I can tell you (and           if you're a 10.1 user I think you can agree) -- it's here.</i></p>        <p><i> I have been looking over the fence a lot lately with a longing for the           rock-bottom prices of the latest Wintel equipment. It's simply spectacular,           what commodification has wrought in making computing available to many,           many people.</i></p>        <p><i>But something makes me hesitate -- this indefinable quality. How much can           Wintel prices drop before I give it up forever? Can I put a price on           it? But how does one assign cost to a quality, especially one that seems           so ethereal and yet so bound up with my own personality...?</i></p>        <p><i>Something else gives me pause, as well. It's Microsoft -- or rather, the           ongoing and flagrant misconduct of the same. I'd like to believe that           the beast of Redmond has reached a point of security where it no longer           needs to snatch every last marble from every last player... but then           I hear something like "we're preventing Opera users from accessing MSN           because we can't guarantee a good experience with non-standards-compliant           [the standard, of course, is anything Microsoft] browsers." Or, "how           'bout we settle this whole legal snafu by increasing our share in the           education market at almost no expense to ourselves?"</i></p>        <p><i>I don't like a corporation that does business that way. </i><i>I           want to use products that I enjoy, and I want to be able to respect           the company from which they come. I can't stick an "actual dollars"           after either one of these considerations -- but they both <code>feel</code>           big.</i></p><p><i>So, where does that leave me? Well, it leaves me a Mac user. It leaves me a little uncertain about the future of my own favorite platform. That's okay, because uncertainty has a certain aesthetic to it, too.</i></p>        <p><i>I don't disrespect the do-it-yourselfers who do the research and           nail the perfect price/performance combination. I think that's supremely           cool. But for me, it's not about the numbers. And all that talk about           "Apple's CD-RWs are 8x, not 12x" or "An 800 MHz G4 is twice the cost           of a 1.6GHZ Athlon" leave me relatively "nonplused."</i></p>        <p><i>Someone has suggested that the thin-margin commodification strategy           seen in the Wintel world today has the ultimate effect of reducing the           perceived value of these products. I wouldn't be surprised to someday           see all the Wintel boxen relegated to the server racks, render farms           and router stations of the world -- while the Apple machines (and Sony           machines and others of like design philosophy) sit proudly in the living           spaces of real human beings who are enjoying a quality they can't quite           name, but who enjoy it all the same.</i></p>        <p><strong>|</strong><b>Usage</b><strong>|</strong><cite>|</cite><em>What           to do with 'em</em><cite>|</cite><br>          <i>Icons and graphics &copy; 2002 John Marstall.
