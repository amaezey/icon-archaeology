These artists are far more established than I, so I think it should be ok for me to omit the shadows as well.Sometimes shadows just complicate an otherwise great icon, or there just isn't room. The shadows also interfere with some Kaliedoscope schemes that use Finder window patterns. Maybe in Mac OS X, when we have 8-bit (shades of transparent!) masks, shadows will make a return.How to make use of Graf Icon Collection as Mac Icons:1. You need system 7 or higher.2.
