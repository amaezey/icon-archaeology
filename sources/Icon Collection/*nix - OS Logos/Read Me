*nix - OS LogosOk, everyone sees (and makes) icons for MacOS X that are supposed to be part of it (applications, folders, etc). This ones are different, because I made them for nerds, geeks or whatever you call us :D. Yes, I've been into linux (for x86, hence the Mandrake and RedHat icons) and even Windows (that in fact was so bad that it made me change into linux even with a 1.2 GB Hd half filled with it... :) ). In fact I began making icons for windows, later linux, and now I'm surrendered to MacOS X. Many of you will not find this icons of any use, but if you have a network with computers running any of this OS's or you have them running in your emulators or simply have a place to use them, then this icons are for you :)All of this icons are 100% free and for personal use only. They are optimized for MacOS X but can be used in any other Mac OS version prior to 8.6. I do not intend to have any credit for the designs (specially the Open BSD icons) because with the exception for the YellowDog icon and the linux PPC all others were build from graphics from the distributor's websites. Anyway, they cannot be modified without my knoledge or distributed if not in their original .sit.hqx format from Xicons.com that must include this readme.For any doubts, questions requests or comments about this set or any other icon related stuff, please e-mail me at pafmax@clix.ptI really hope you enjoy this icons,Pedro Fern‡ndez
