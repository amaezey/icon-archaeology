The application icons depicted in the docklings are copyright of their respective owners- i.e. Microsoft, Graphic Converter, Apple, and Felt Tip Software.

I made the icons to use in the dock, in place of just folders for each type of document. If you have any suggestions just email me- kmason@mac.com
