It started               in February 2001 as my attempt to grapple with OS X as the immenent               icon environment, and I've certainly learned a lot over the past               year! Looking back over what I had done so far, I was feeling the               way I always feel when looking at year-old icons of mine: &quot;I               could do better than that now!&quot; :-)<br>              <br>              After all the OS X work we ended up doing for clients this past               year, I felt I had definitely gained a bit of ground, so I wanted               to re-visit the series, apply what I've learned thus far and bring               it up to date.<br>              <br>              WOA 3 is much more in line with Apple's Aqua icon guidelines, and               hopefully will blend in very smoothly with the rest of the system.               I've updated the folders with the look of Apple's standard folder               (albeit at a different angle) and I changed the badging angle. Every               single element has either been reworked or replaced, so I hope this               feels like a &quot;next generation&quot; for the series.<br>              <br>              Amongst the various system-type treats, you'll find a much-requested               OS X version of HAL 9000, the new iPod and, of course, the sassy               new iMac!<br>              <br>              I hope you enjoy the new icons, and thanks to everyone who has downloaded               the World Of Aqua series and supported the Iconfactory!<br>              <br>              Tack s&aring; mycket!<br>              <br>              Dave<br>              <br>            </p>            </div>							</td>						</tr>						<tr>							<td width="130" valign="top">								<div align="right">									<b><span class="boldbody">Work Notes</span></b></div>							</td>							<td valign="top"></td>							        <td width="450" valign="top">These icons were created in Adobe Photoshop           with IconBuilder Pro and are designed for use with OS 8.5 thru OS X.           The artwork incorporated into these icons was generated by hand specifically           for them.

In Mac OS 9 (and earlier), when you press Command-I, you get a Get Info window for each item you have selected in the Finder. With Mac OS X, there is no Get Info.<br>								<br>																	Get Info has been replaced with an &quot;Inspector&quot;. The inspector is shown or hidden when you press Command-I. It also behaves differently; every time you select something in the Finder, the inspector shows additional information about the item. The good news is that even though the Inspector works differently, it still allows you to change icons for most desktop items.<br>								<br>																	Here is a step-by-step guide for setting a folder icon:<br>																	1) Select a file or folder that has the icon you want to use.<br>																	2) Press Command-I to bring up the Inspector panel.<br>																	3) Click on the icon once. You should see a gray border around the icon (see figure.)<br>																	4) Press Command-C to copy the icon. Do NOT close the inspector panel.<br>																	5) Select the file or folder that you want to customize. Press Command-V to paste the icon.<br>																	That's it!<br>								<br>							</td>						</tr>						<tr>							<td width="130" valign="top">								<div align="right">									<b><span class="boldbody">iControl</span></b><br>								</div>							</td>							<td valign="top"></td>							<td width="450" valign="top">What is iControl?<br>								<br>								iControl is quite simply the easiest, quickest, and most friendly way to change every icon in your Mac's System Folder... plus the Trash Can!

The Finder only copies and pastes the new style. This is a more efficient use of disk space.<br>								<br>																	However, if you paste the Mac OS 8.5 icon on removable media, such as a floppy or Zip disk, the icon won't show up when you move to an older version of the OS. You'll also have problems on a network server and an older client Mac.<br>								<br>								By default, the Iconfactory's IconDropper utility pastes both kinds of icons so they will show up on any version of the OS that supports custom icons.

Many people find that it is much easier to find a file that you are looking for by spotting a cool, colorful icon rather than by its name. Icons can be cut and pasted onto almost any item on the Macintosh. For the most part however, they are just a whole lot of fun. As for how to apply them, here is the most straight forward way:<br>								<br>																	1. On your desktop, select the icon you would like to use<br>																	2. Select &quot;Get Info&quot; (command-I) from the File Menu for that icon<br>																	3. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window<br>																	4. Choose &quot;Copy&quot; (command-C) from the Edit menu<br>																	5. Close the window<br>																	6. Select the file/folder you want to apply that icon to<br>																	7. Select &quot;Get Info&quot; (File menu) for that icon<br>																	8. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window<br>																	9. Select &quot;Paste&quot; (command-V) from the Edit Menu.<br>																	(this method won't work on the trash can)<br>																	10.
