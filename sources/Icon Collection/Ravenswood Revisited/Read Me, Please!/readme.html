In one of my rare concessions to popular demand, I've re-created them as OS X icons for your edification. I made the original icons in just one day, in a flurry of activity. These OS X versions took more than a month to complete! Such is the nature of X.<br>						<br>						Some people have written to ask if Ravenswood is an actual story or book, and the answer is that it is just something whimsical from my imagination. It's a melting pot of different horror themes and styles I have soaked up over years. The various sources range from the &quot;Mystery&quot; series I used to watch on PBS in the U.S., to gothic-styled etchings and drawings by artists like Edward Gorey, Mervyn Peake and Tim Burton, not forgetting films like Hitchcock's 1940 &quot;<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0032976" target="_blank">Rebecca</a>&quot; and 1941 &quot;<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0034248" target="_blank">Suspicion</a>&quot;, and Robert Wise's 1963 &quot;<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0057129" target="_blank">The Haunting</a>&quot;. <br>						<br>						Lastly, the icon called &quot;The Skeleton Bride&quot; is based on an indelible image from a film I once saw as a child, that of a veiled bride drifting through manor gardens in the moonlight towards the main house, and finally knocking on the front door. For years, I had no idea what this film was, as I only saw the second half on television one day. I finally tracked down the name of this film: 1958's &quot;<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0052169" target="_blank">The Screaming Skull</a>&quot;, evidently considered a poor-quality B-movie by most. I believe it was even roasted once on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. At any rate, that scene scared the daylights out of me at the time, and the icon is my recognition of this persistent memory.<br>						<br>						The accompanying desktop picture for these icons (in all the latest resolutions) can be found at the <a href="http://www.pixelhaus.com" target="_blank">Pixelhaus</a>.</font><font color="#999999" face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>					</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>					</font><font color="#999999" face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva">Happy Halloween,<br>												Dave</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>						<br>						<br>					</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b><font color="#6666ff">Legality:</font></b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>						<font color="#999999">The enclosed icons are &copy;2002 The Iconfactory.

In Mac OS 9 (and earlier), when you press Command-I, you get a Get Info window for each item you have selected in the Finder. With Mac OS X, there is no Get Info.<br>						<br>																		Get Info has been replaced with &quot;Show Info&quot;. The Show Info inspector is shown or hidden when you press Command-I. It also behaves differently; every time you select something in the Finder, the inspector shows additional information about the item. The good news is that even though the inspector works differently, it still allows you to change icons for most desktop items.<br>						<br>																		Here is a step-by-step guide for setting a folder icon:<br>																		1) Select a file or folder that has the icon you want to use.<br>																		2) Press Command-I to bring up the inspector panel.<br>																		3) Click on the icon once. You should see a gray border around the icon (see figure.)<br>																		4) Press Command-C to copy the icon. Do NOT close the inspector panel.<br>																		5) Select the file or folder that you want to customize. Press Command-V to paste the icon.<br>						<br>																		Depending on the icon being replaced, you may need to restart the computer to view the new icon.<br>						<br>																		That's it!<br>						<br>						<br>					</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b><font color="#6666ff">Setting Classic Mac Icons:</font></b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>					</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#999999">The most common use of custom icons is as a replacement for the standard file and folder icons that are built into your Mac's operating system. Many people find that it is much easier to find a file that you are looking for by spotting a cool, colorful icon rather than by its name. Icons can be cut and pasted onto almost any item on the Macintosh. For the most part however, they are just a whole lot of fun. As for how to apply them, here is the most straight forward way:<br>						<br>																		1. On your desktop, select the icon you would like to use<br>																		2. Select &quot;Get Info&quot; (command-I) from the File Menu for that icon<br>																		3. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window<br>																		4. Choose &quot;Copy&quot; (command-C) from the Edit menu<br>																		5. Close the window<br>																		6. Select the file/folder you want to apply that icon to<br>																		7. Select &quot;Get Info&quot; (File menu) for that icon<br>																		8. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window<br>																		9. Select &quot;Paste&quot; (command-V) from the Edit Menu.<br>																		(this method won't work on the trash can)<br>																		10. You're done!</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>						<br>					</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#999999"><br>					</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b><font color="#6666ff">Contact The Author:</font></b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>						<font color="#999999">Dave Brasgalla - </font><a href="mailto:dave@iconfactory.com"><font color="#6666ff">dave@iconfactory.com</font></a><br>						<br>						<font color="#999999">The Iconfactory - </font><a href="mailto:webmaster@iconfactory.com"><font color="#6666ff">webmaster@iconfactory.com</font></a><br>						<br>						<font color="#33FF00"><br>						</font></font><font color="#6666ff" face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><b>More       Stuff for your Mac:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>						<font color="#999999">As a showcase for all of our pixel-pushing icon work,       we've created a place called The Iconfactory.
