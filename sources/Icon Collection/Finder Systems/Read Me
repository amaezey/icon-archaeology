Finder/System Resources Icons©  Jason Wiggins 1999These icons are replacements of the Finder & System Resources file icons. To use these icons, just drop the resources -16482 & 3 into the System file. Using ResEdit, open the COPY of your System file and open the icon file of your choice. Select all, copy, select the System file and paste. You will be asked if you want a unique ID or to replace the files. Select replace. Remember to do this on a copy of your System file. When you restart, the Finder and System Resources files inside your System folder will be of your new icon.Enjoy,Jason Wiggins,jwiggins@ozemail.com.auP.S.
