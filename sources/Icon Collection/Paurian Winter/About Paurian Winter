I can’t recall ever seeing a general winter collection, although I’ve seen plenty of seasonal (Christmas, new Year, Chanukah) sets. Before moving to Colorado, I had lived in the south and south-west areas of the U.S. where snow is rare and occurs once every few years. The shimmering glow that newly fallen snow gives has been seen many times already this year. Snow and Ice are the key themes in this collection.At first, I thought of building each snow flake by hand, but in time that proved to be too difficult and the result were unnatural. Around this time I had rediscovered POVRay (a wonderful freeware rendering program that takes scripts in it’s language to build and render scenes) and wrote a script to generate the snow flakes for me, then took the snow flakes, resized them to the 32x32 Icon size, touched them up quite a bit, and selected the best of them. This script is included in the extras folder for you to play with and make snow-flake patterns of your own. If you ever develop a pack of icons using this script (as it is, or modified in any way) please e-mail me and let me know (also please mention it in your read-me file).Again, I dedicate this set to Paula who has been a wonderful encouragement, and to God who shapes each flake of snow.Legality - Terms of use:By using this product you agree to the terms of this agreement.The file used to extract this text and all associated files, in binhex (.hqx) or stuffit (.sit) format herein is named "this package".

Take your evil deeds out of my sight! Stop doing wrong, learn to do right! Seek justice, encourage those whoare oppressed. Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow.Come now, let us reason together,” says the LORD. “Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.”   - Isaiah 1:16-18For more information, please visit the Paurian Café website at:http://members.xoom.com/paurian/soapbox/eternity.html
