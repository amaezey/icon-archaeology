Some of the icons you see in the enclosed collection have come from late night sketch-sessions, some have come from contract work that never went anywhere. The majority of them however were designed just for this release, especially all of the U.S. related ones near the top of the window. <br>				<br>				As we write this, it has been a little over two weeks since the tragic terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington D.C.. Almost immediately afterwards, we started receiving e-mail asking if we would make some icons of American flags or knew where people could download them. It seems that displaying a flag on your home or car simply wasn't enough anymore. Many people wanted to proudly display flags on their desktop as well. We are only too happy to help out in this respect and have created several flag icons as well as a few other appropriate patriotic items in the Copland style.<br>				<br>				We hope you enjoy our latest creation for pre-Mac OS X users. The World of Copland series has been one of our most successful to date, and helped get The Iconfactory where it is today. We're proud to be able to continue the collection, and we hope you'll take a moment to remember all the people who lost their lives on September 11th. We dedicate this icon collection to them, and hope it will make your day just a bit brighter. Enjoy.<br>				<br>				</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>Legality:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>				The enclosed icons are &copy;2001 The Iconfactory.

The Finder only copies and pastes the new style. This is a more efficient use of disk space.<br>				<br>				However, if you paste the Mac OS 8.5 icon on removable media, such as a floppy or Zip disk, the icon won't show up when you move to an older version of the OS. You'll also have problems on a network server and an older client Mac.<br>				<br>				By default, the Iconfactory's IconDropper 3.2 utility pastes both kinds of icons so they will show up on any version of the OS that supports custom icons. To learn more about IconDropper 3.2, please visit the Iconfactory at &lt;http://www.iconfactory.com&gt; Thanks!<br>				<br>				</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>How To make Use of Icons:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>				The most common use of custom icons is as a replacement for the standard file and folder icons that are built into your Mac's operating system. Many people find that it is much easier to find a file that you are looking for by spotting a cool, colorful icon rather than by its name. Icons can be cut and pasted onto almost any item on the Macintosh. For the most part however, they are just a whole lot of fun. As for how to apply them, here is the most straight forward way:<br>				<br>				1. On your desktop, select the icon you would like to use<br>				2. Select &quot;Get Info&quot; (command-I) from the File Menu for that icon<br>				3. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window<br>				4. Choose &quot;Copy&quot; (command-C) from the Edit menu<br>				5. Close the window<br>				6. Select the file/folder you want to apply that icon to<br>				7. Select &quot;Get Info&quot; (File menu) for that icon<br>				8. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window<br>				9. Select &quot;Paste&quot; (command-V) from the Edit Menu.<br>				(this method won't work on the trash can)<br>				10. You're done!<br>				<br>				</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>Contact The Authors:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>				Dave Brasgalla - <a href="mailto:dave@iconfactory.com">dave@iconfactory.com</a><br>				Kate England - <a href="mailto:kate@iconfactory.com">kate@iconfactory.com</a><br>				Gedeon Maheux - <a href="mailto:gedeon@iconfactory.com">gedeon@iconfactory.com</a><br>				Corey Marion - <a href="mailto:corey@iconfactory.com">corey@iconfactory.com</a><br>				Talos Tsui - <a href="mailto:talos@iconfactory.com">talos@iconfactory.com</a><br>				<br>				The Iconfactory - <a href="mailto:webmaster@iconfactory.com">webmaster@iconfactory.com</a><br>				<br>				</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>More Stuff for your Mac:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>				As a showcase for all of our pixel-pushing icon work, we've created a place called The Iconfactory.
