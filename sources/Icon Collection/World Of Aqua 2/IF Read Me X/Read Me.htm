The Macintosh world as we know it       is shifting over to X, slowly and surely.<br>      <br>      The Iconfactory's early success was based in large degree on the &quot;World       Of Copland&quot; series, which gave users tightly-crafted alternative icons       for everyday objects and system components in Apple's latest style. Copland       was all the rage then, but Apple has now abandoned that look for a sleek       photo-realistic approach. With that in mind, I decided to take the &quot;World       Of...&quot; series into the new millennium.<br>      <br>      </font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva">This is the second       installment of the new series, providing all sorts of fun new iconography       that will look great with your new system! This time around, you'll find       replacement folders for the User-level directories that weren't covered       in WOA1, the newest Apple portable hardware, plus all sorts of everyday       objects with a global flair, from Japanese postboxes to classic Swedish       telephones.<br>      <br>      If what you want isn't in this set, it will most likely show up soon in       another!<br>      In the meantime, you can start pasting these around your Macintosh as you       set about making OS X your new home. If you don't have X yet, these can       help you get that &quot;lickable&quot; look and feel until you make the       big move...<br>      <br>      Dave<br>      <br>      </font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>Thanks       &amp; Acknowledgements:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>      Special thanks to everyone who took the time to write in with suggestions       and feedback after WOA1 was released!<br>      <br>      As always, thanks to Ged, Mindy, Talos, Corey and especially Kate for invaluable       support, advice, critique and brainstorming. <br>      <br>      A million thanks to Craig Hockenberry for IconBuilder Pro, without which       I would *still* be assembling these.

In Mac OS       9 (and earlier), when you press Command-I, you get a Get Info window for       each item you have selected in the Finder. With Mac OS X, there is no Get       Info.<br>      <br>      Get Info has been replaced with an &quot;Inspector&quot;. The inspector       is shown or hidden when you press Command-I. It also behaves differently;       every time you select something in the Finder, the inspector shows additional       information about the item. The good news is that even though the Inspector       works differently, it still allows you to change icons for most desktop       items.<br>      <br>      Here is a step-by-step guide for setting a folder icon:<br>      1) Select a file or folder that has the icon you want to use.<br>      2) Press Command-I to bring up the Inspector panel.<br>      3) Click on the icon once. You should see a gray border around the icon       (see figure.)<br>      4) Press Command-C to copy the icon. Do NOT close the inspector panel.<br>      5) Select the file or folder that you want to customize. Press Command-V       to paste the icon.<br>      That's it!<br>      <br>      </font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>Changing       the Hard Drive</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>      You may notice that the copy and paste operation mentioned above won't work<br>      on the main hard drive. When you click on the icon, there is no gray border.<br>      To change the hard drive, we suggest you download our helpful PDF guide       to setting desktop icons for Mac OS X.<br>      <br>      <a href="http://www.iconfactory.com/software/setting_osx_icons.hqx">http://www.iconfactory.com/software/setting_osx_icons.hqx</a><br>      <br>      <br>      </font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>Important       Notes About Copying &amp; Pasting 8.5+ Icons</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>      In Mac OS 8.5 and above, there are two types of custom icons you can use:       old-style with only 256 colors and the new style with 32-bit icons. The       Finder only copies and pastes the new style. This is a more efficient use       of disk space.<br>      <br>      However, if you paste the Mac OS 8.5 icon on removable media, such as a       floppy or Zip disk, the icon won't show up when you move to an older version       of the OS. You'll also have problems on a network server and an older client       Mac.<br>      <br>      By default, the Iconfactory's IconDropper 3.2 utility pastes both kinds       of icons so they will show up on any version of the OS that supports custom       icons. To learn more about IconDropper 3.2, please visit the Iconfactory       at &lt;<a href="http://www.iconfactory.com">http://www.iconfactory.com</a>&gt;       Thanks!<br>      <br>      </font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>How       To make Use of Icons:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>      The most common use of custom icons is as a replacement for the standard       file and folder icons that are built into your Mac's operating system. Many       people find that it is much easier to find a file that you are looking for       by spotting a cool, colorful icon rather than by its name. Icons can be       cut and pasted onto almost any item on the Macintosh. For the most part       however, they are just a whole lot of fun. As for how to apply them, here       is the most straight forward way:<br>      <br>      1. On your desktop, select the icon you would like to use<br>      2. Select &quot;Get Info&quot; (command-I) from the File Menu for that icon<br>      3. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window<br>      4. Choose &quot;Copy&quot; (command-C) from the Edit menu<br>      5. Close the window<br>      6. Select the file/folder you want to apply that icon to<br>      7. Select &quot;Get Info&quot; (File menu) for that icon<br>      8. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window<br>      9. Select &quot;Paste&quot; (command-V) from the Edit Menu.<br>      (this method won't work on the trash can)<br>      10. You're done!<br>      <br>      </font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>Contact       The Author:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>      Dave Brasgalla - <a href="mailto:dave@iconfactory.com"> dave@iconfactory.com</a><br>      <br>      The Iconfactory - <a href="mailto:webmaster@iconfactory.com">webmaster@iconfactory.com</a><br>      <br>      </font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva" color="#0066cc"><b>More       Stuff for your Mac:</b></font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva"><br>      As a showcase for all of our pixel-pushing icon work, we've created a place       called The Iconfactory.
