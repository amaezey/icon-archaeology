The Devil's Desktop Presents:The Dot Studio's Icon Set.I had downloaded this icon set about a year or so ago. These icons were in gif format and only available for windows machines. I converted them though and emailed the author, asking him if it would be ok to link his site and upload them to mine. I knew that macintosh users would love to use these great icons. Well, I got a real nasty reply from him about how he didn't want anyone editing or changing his icons. I didn't change one thing about them except make them usable on Macintosh Computers. It's been awhile and I decided to upload them anyway. I am not sure how long they will be online though. So here they are if you get them great if you miss out, well I guess you will never know then. I did not create these, I just made them available for Macintosh users.ThanksFor more great icons and desktop pictures for Macintosh and Windows visit the Devil's Desktop atwww.blindzero.com/gui
