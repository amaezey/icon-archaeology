WHAT'S WITH THE CORRECTIONS FOLDER?Due to volume 1 being my first upload, I hadn't workedall the "kinks" out yet. I left some icons on plain foldersinstead of putting them on the little application. When the file was downloaded, the icons that were on folders  "disappeared." I didn't know that I had failed to set thebundle bits correctly on those folders. Live and Learn.I received e-mails asking for the missing icons. So I corrected those icons and re-sent the file to the archivefor future downloaders. For the first version downloaders, I haveincluded a "Corrections" folder with this Volume 2, which provides the "missing" icons. They are:1) Sam & Larry from Moe's Tavern2) The Simpson folders (with small icons)Also in this Corrections folder are 3 other changes thatall downloaders of Volume 1 can benefit from:1) The typo in the nuclear power plant's balloon help was corrected.2) The space between Otto's earphones and his head was       corrected, so that it would not highlight.3) On the Marge small icon folder, her hair has now been      completely filled in.Lastly, in Volume 1 there were 4 characters that I did not know the names for, but do now. They are:Twin #1 = Sherri          (Sherri & Terri in neighborhood kids folder)Twin #2 = TerriPolice guy = Eddie        (Policemen in Public figures folder)Police guy #2 = LouI included the names in a later version, but first timedownloaders will need this information to properlyidentify those characters.I want to thank all those patient people out there, whohelped me identify the problems and correct them, andhelped me to better understand how to make icons.If you see any mistakes in this Volume 2 (hopefully I'venow been careful enough to keep that from happening),please e-mail me and let me know, and I will correct them.Thank you.Jeanette Fosheex1foshee@exnet.iastate.edu
