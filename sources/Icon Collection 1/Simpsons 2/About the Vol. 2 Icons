*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^**    THE SIMPSONS ICON COLLECTION, VOLUME TWO    **^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*November, 1993Well, here it is. The second group of icons. I want tothank all the folks out there who sent me e-mailand provided me with lots of incentive to get this out.I've gotten tons of great suggestions for icons and want to thank everyone for their help. I would also like to thank the people who sent me pictures, whichpromptly got turned into more icons.Unbelievably, the collection still is not complete; I am at this moment making still more guest stars and secondary characters. It is a testimony to the Simpsons show that so many characters have graced it in the 4+ years it's existed. I will try to get to as many of them as I can in my third volume of Simpsons icons, which will be released next year. I will concentrate mostly on the suggestions that peoplehave e-mailed me. So it's to your advantage to e-mailme and give me your ideas for icons.These icons are free for your enjoyment. So instead of asking for money (which I couldn't do anyway, as they are copyrighted characters), all I ask is that if you like these icons and keep them, please send me either an e-mail or a postcard and let me know what you think of them. I thrive on feedback, and would be interested in all comments. (And besides, the more e-mail I get, the faster I'll get the third collection done. And the moreicons will result, as I get suggestions.)Once again I want thank Dave Schutz for the use of hissmall "bogus" application, that I put my icons on. Theapplication doesn't really work; double-clicking on itwill do nothing. It's just there to provide funny balloon help. When you turn on balloon help in system 7 on the Mac and put your cursor over each icon, the text in the balloon has been changed to a funny quote from the Simpsons show for that character. No sound.Dave's "Colossal Icons" collection features some of thebest animation icons I've ever seen.
