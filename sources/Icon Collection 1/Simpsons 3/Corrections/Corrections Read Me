WHAT'S WITH THE CORRECTIONS FOLDER AGAIN?!?And here I thought I had perfected my method of iconing.....I had, but then I got a tad careless, and missed a b/w resource in 13 of my icons. Horrors! So even though I promised that there would be no more "corrections," there is this time. I've fixed the icons that didn't have a correct resource, and am including them with this collection.TAKE NOTE!!! These corrections are for all volumes, all versions, so they apply to everyone. Please take the time to make the appropriate substitutions.If you see any other mistakes in the 3 volumes (hopefully I'venow been careful enough to keep that from happening),please e-mail me and let me know, and I will correct them.Thank you.Jeanette Fosheex1foshee@exnet.iastate.eduP.S.--I keep my monitor on thousands of colors most of the time, so I didn't check on the b/w resource visually like I should have. Now, I do that check. So volumes hereafter shouldn't have any missing resources or corrections. Once again, thanks for your patience!
