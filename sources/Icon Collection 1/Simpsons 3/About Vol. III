*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^**   THE SIMPSONS ICON COLLECTION, VOLUME THREE  **^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*July, 1994And yet another collection of icons hits the networks. Is there an end to this? Hopefully not, if the Simpsons show never ends. I want to thank all the nice people  who sent me e-mail. If all the suggestions I've gotten for new icons is any barometer, I think my icons are being well received. And I'd say a fourth volume isdefinitely in the works. I'm still taking suggestions, too,so keep 'em coming, folks! :-)If by some chance an icon isn't present in this volume, it's not by intention. I tried to get to as many requests as was humanly possible. What icons I didn't get tohere, I will try to include in volume four (they've beensaved on a list, so I haven't forgotten them).I would also like to note that I've gotten several thingsback from people who have put my icons to interestinguses. If by some chance you have done some neat thingwith my icons, feel free to send me a copy. I'm delightedto see the creativity out there!I would like to take a moment to thank one person, without whose help I could not have made this third volume. He spent many an hour video capturing images from his Simpson tapes for me to work from. I owe him greatly for his generosity. Thanks so much, Kevin.One embarrassing note: I found, to my chagrin, that I had missed a b/w resource here and there in my icons. So eventhough I promised that there would be no more "corrections,"there is this time. I've fixed the icons that didn't have a correct resource, and am including them with this collection.Take note:  these corrections are for all volumes, all versions,so they apply to everyone. Please take the time to make theappropriate substitutions.One last note:  If you haven't gotten it yet, do get theSimpsons Gunshy game. A friend (thanks so much, Mig!) used my icons as tiles in this public domain game, and the result is great fun for Simpson fans. Look for this game at the addresses listed below the paragraph about Dave Schutz's icons (mentioned later). And also, look for a mega-challenging version of the Simpsons gunshy game to appear soon. This version will feature icons fromall three volumes, and will have 4 different icons matching each other. For example, the 4 Flanders family members will match each other, the 4 B Sharps will match, and so on. I'll call this game "Tough Simpsons Gunshy" when Iupload it.Okay, I lied. One final note:  I was dissatisfied with theway Maude Flanders and Mrs. Hibbert looked when I firsticoned them. So I've made a second icon for each in this volume.I say this just in case people are curious as to why they're there.=====================================================NOW THE USUAL NOTES:These icons are free for your enjoyment. So instead of asking for money (which I couldn't do anyway, as they are copyrighted characters), all I ask is that if you like these icons and keep them, please send me either an e-mail or a postcard and let me know what you think of them. I thrive on feedback, and would be interested in all comments. (And besides, the more mail I get, thefaster I work on the next volume, and the more icons will result, as I get suggestions.)I want thank Dave Schutz for the use of his small "bogus" application, that I put my icons on. Theapplication doesn't really work; double-clicking on itwill do nothing. It's just there to provide funny balloon help. When you turn on balloon help in system 7 on the Mac and put your cursor over each icon, the text in the balloon has been changed to a funny quote from the Simpsons show for that character. No sound.Dave's "Colossal Icons" collection features some of thebest animation icons I've ever seen. You can find them at the following addresses:sumex-aim.stanford.edu/info-mac/gui/grfwuarchive.wustl.edu/mirrors/info-mac/gui/grfftp.hawaii.edu/mirrors/info-mac/gui/grf(or any info-mac mirror)LEGAL STUFF:  You may freely distribute this collection ofSimpson icons, provided you distribute the collection in its original form with all the files intact, give me credit, and do not charge anything for them. If you do use theseicons, I would be delighted to see what you've done. Feel free to send things to me that use my icons, and thanks!________________________________________/      H O W    T O    U S E    T H E S E    I C O N S        //_______________________________________/1.
