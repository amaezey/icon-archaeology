*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^**    THE  ULTIMATE  SIMPSONS  ICON  COLLECTION     **^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*September, 1993Being a Simpsons fan, I have enjoyed OFF icons made by other folks out there. However, since none of the icon collections featured a wide variety of Springfield characters, and being possessed of the Simpsons Illustrated magazine, I felt it my duty (and pleasure) to bring to the world the most complete collection of Simpson icons yet to be found.I do not have the full collection here; some major secondary characters are missing, which I intend to create, in a second Simpsons collection, hopefully before the end of the year.I think icons should be for the enjoyment of all, without hidden costs.  So instead of asking for money (which I couldn't do anyway, as they are copyrighted characters), I would ask one thing--if you like these icons and keep them, please send me either a postcard or an e-mail and let me know what you think of them. I thrive on feedback, and would be interested in all comments, flames and concerns expressed by everyone. (And besides, the more e-mail I get, the faster I'll get the second collection done!)I also want to take one last paragraph to give thanks to Dave Schutz, whose icons I have enjoyed immensely. They're some of the best out there, in a "Colossal Icon" collection. He used a wonderful little application to put his icons on. When you turn on balloon help (in System 7), these icons "speak." I have borrowed this application, and have put my Simpsons icons on them, so they, too, can have voices.I hope you enjoy my icons. It was a "labor" of true fandom. (Is making Simpson icons really "work?")LEGAL STUFF:  You may freely distribute this collection ofSimpson icons, provided you give me credit, distributethem in their original form, and include the "About theSimpsons Icons" read me with them.________________________________________/      H O W    T O    U S E    T H E S E    I C O N S        //_______________________________________/1.
