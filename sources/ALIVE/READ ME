Sprinkle your desktop with them and see what happens. No ... please ... don't thank me for the tons of new friends and admirers you'll acquire. My CatchIf you really like these little pretties, I could really use a breathtakingly low shareware fee of $2. I'm not making you pay it; you might be unable to afford. But if you can pay, my family and I thank you. If you can't pay, grace me with an e-mail greeting.My PitchGraphic arts is what I do. And I want to do it for you. I'm accepting projects and would be tickled pink to be included in your next one. Contact me!My AdviceEat well, sleep well, exercise, read, make art, and use a Mac.My WorldSend check for $2 in U.S. currency to: Brian Brasher, 528 Triple Creek Drive, Morris, AL 35116. Thanks! God bless you.
