ikthusian arts icons    ikthusian@aol.comhttp://members.aol.com/ikthusianA few words concerning this, your newest iconic acquisition:Thanks for downloading the Geometria Tech icon set. The Geometria series comes to a halt with these technologically 3-dimensional pixellations. Yes, you will see the future in icon format. Your desktop will be propelled into the next century. You will wake up tomorrow and know that the future is brighter, for your Geometria collection is now and forever complete.And here, my friend, are the dreaded attached strings:If you enjoy this set, I humbly request the oh so insignificant sum of $2. We here in the ikthusian household really let out a hearty "hoorah" when shareware funds arrive. However, I fully understand that there may exist an inability to pay said fee. If you can't afford, send an e-mail greeting instead.Here you'll find a shameless plug:Through the daylight hours I earn my keep as a graphic artist. I would consider it an honor to be considered for your next creative project. Phrase your needs and send that information to me today! And here you'll find me:Brian Brasher528 Triple Creek DriveMorris, AL 35116USABefore you use these icons for anything other than personal desktop embellishment, I insist that you visit http://members.aol.com/ikthusian/stop.html. And, as always, eat well, sleep well, exercise, read, make art, and use a Mac. God bless you. Have a nice day.°
